            Here's a feature of all of my favourite hobbies and projects! <br> <br> Below, I have samples of various forms of academic writing, music I cover or create, clothes I design and sew from scratch and much more! <br> I'm also currently obsessed with my new 3D printer, so I've been putting AutoCAD to good use as well. Hope you enjoy!

            This is the first print I have designed! I recently got a Creality Ender-5 3D Printer and I created this in AutoCAD. I wanted to make a little storage unit in the garage entry-way to hold masks in a clean and compact manner, so I devised this basket that hangs onto our shelf. It took nearly 24 hours to print and about 300g of filament, but I think it was worth it! <br> <br>
            From left to right: Finished product, first few base layers being printed, built nearly complete, the design being sliced. <br>
            Then, there's a quick youtube video to show a 360 view of the design.

            I recently saw this adorable photo of a possum (on the left)! My friend and I both agreed that it would look very cute as an outline tattoo, so I took to create a digital sketch of it!

            With the Covid lockdown, I'm always looking for new things to keep my hands busy with. Since it's been cold outside and my overflowing craft bin was begging me to create something new, I decided to crochet the perfect winter hat! I definitely recommend taking some time off to crochet while listening to a podcast, watching TV or reading. <br> <br> I used my trusty 8.0 mm hook and 1/4 of a skein of Bernat's Baby Blanket Yarn in two different colours.
