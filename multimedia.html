            Here's a feature of all of my favourite hobbies and projects! Below, I have samples of various forms of academic writing, music I cover or create, as well as clothes I've designed and sewn from scratch! I'm also currently obsessed with my new 3D printer, so I've been putting AutoCAD to good use as well. Hope you enjoy!

            This is the first print I have designed! I recently got a Creality Ender-5 3D Printer and I created this in AutoCAD. I wanted to make a little storage unit in the garage entry-way to hold masks in a clean and compact manner, so I devised this basket that hangs onto our shelf. It took nearly 24 hours to print, and about 300g of filament, but I think it was worth it! <br> <br>
            From left to right: Finished product, first few base layers being printed, built nearly complete, the design being sliced. <br>
            Then, there's a quick youtube video to show a 360 view of the design.
